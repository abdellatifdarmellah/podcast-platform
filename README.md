#readme file for my podcast app it's a podcast platform like spotify. I used intelliJ as my coding space I made it using JAVAFX and SceneBuilder, and I created the UI with Figma. I spent in total making it 20h.

When you launch this app for the first time, you will go to the log in page where you can type your account informations, if you don't have an account; you can click on the sign up button to create a new account - all the infos are saved in a txt file after log in successfully, you are now in the home page; to the left you have the dashboard, in the center you have the actuals podcasts, to the right you have the top casters, and in the bottom you have play/pause, next, previous, replay, shufle volume slider and volume icon, mp3 slider, title, caster name, podcast image

the app isn't completed since I didn't have time to finish it because it's for university but it has all the functionalities needed
